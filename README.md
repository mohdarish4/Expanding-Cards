<h1>Expanding Cards</h1>

An expanding card is a user interface component often used in web design to showcase content or information in a visually appealing and interactive way. The concept typically involves a set of cards, each representing a different item, topic, or piece of content. When a user interacts with a card, it expands to reveal more details, providing additional information or visuals.
