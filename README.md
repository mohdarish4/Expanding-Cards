<h1>Expanding Cards</h1>

An expanding card is like a digital card that reveals more information when you click on it. Imagine you have a set of cards on a webpage, each with a picture and a title. Normally, you only see a bit of information. However, when you click on a card, it expands to show more details or a larger view of the content.
